Iâ€™m looking for a post-doc to work on the dynamics of neural networks (two
years, starting around Sep 2021). If you're excited about this area, motivated,
and hold a PhD in theoretical physics, applied math, or classical machine
learning, please apply! Strong analytical skills and an interest in conducting
numerical experiments are important.

PhD students

I'm looking for one PhD student to work on the theory of neural networks
starting in September 2021. The student would join the SISSA PhD programme in
Data Science. Here are some quick facts:

- You're fully funded for four years
- You follow classes in machine learning, neural networks, etc. during your
  first year
- You then have three years to do your PhD research.

Have a look at this year's edition:
[https://www.sissa.it/dipartimento-di-eccellenza](https://www.sissa.it/dipartimento-di-eccellenza). 

Admissions occur via a written exam and an interview with the faculty.
