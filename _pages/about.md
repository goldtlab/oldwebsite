We are working on theories of learning in artificial and biological neural
networks. We are motivated by the large gap between the recent successes of
neural networks in machine learning and our understanding of their foundational
properties, which is still very limited. We combine a mix of theory and
numerical experiments to close this gap. Our current focus is on understanding
how the interplay between data structure, training and architecture shapes
learning.  </p>
