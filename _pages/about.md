I am an Assistant Professor at the International School of Advanced Studies
([SISSA](www.sissa.it)) in beautiful Trieste (Italy), where I am currently
setting up the Theory of Neural Networks group.

My current research interest are theories of learning in artificial and
biological neural networks. We are motivated by the large gap between the recent
successes of neural networks in machine learning and our understanding of their
foundational properties, which is still very limited. We combine a mix of theory
and numerical experiments to close this gap. Our current focus is on
understanding how the interplay between data structure, training and
architecture shapes learning.  </p>
