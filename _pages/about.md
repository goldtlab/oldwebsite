üëã We are a research group at the International School of Advanced Studies
([SISSA](http://www.sissa.it)) in beautiful Trieste (Italy), led by Sebastian Goldt. <a

üî¨ We are working on theories of learning in artificial and biological neural
networks. We are motivated by the large gap between the recent successes of
neural networks in machine learning and our understanding of their foundational
properties, which is still very limited. We combine a mix of theory and
numerical experiments to close this gap. Our current focus is on understanding
how the interplay between data structure, training and architecture shapes
learning. Take a look at <a href="./research.html">some recent highlights</a>! </p>

We&ast; are organising the second edition of our conference ‚ÄúYouth in high
dimensions‚Äù online from June 15th-18th. Our goal is to give emerging researchers
the opportunity to gather and to present their results, focusing on
high-dimensional problems arising in machine learning, inference, statistical
physics, and neuroscience. Of course, everybody at any career stage is welcome
to attend.</p>

Registration is free and possible [via our
website](http://indico.ictp.it/event/9596/). We have a great line-up of invited
speakers and we will have a virtual poster session during the conference. Please
also consider submitting your work as a poster, and attend the conference!

See you in June!

Organised with [J. Barbier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeanbarbier/)
(ICTP), [M. Gabri√©](https://marylou-gabrie.github.io/) (NYU / Flatiron), and
[M.  Mondelli](http://marcomondelli.com/) (IST Vienna).
