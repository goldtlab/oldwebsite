I am Assistant Professor in the nascent Department of Data Science at SISSA. I
studied physics at Cambridge University and did my PhD with Udo Seifert at the
University of Stuttgart, where I worked on the stochastic thermodynamics of
learning. Before coming to Trieste, I spent three years as a post-doc with
Florent Krzakala and Lenka Zdeborova in Paris studying the theory of neural
networks.</p>

Doğan is a student of the Master in Data Science and Scientific Computing at the
University of Trieste. For his thesis, he is working on the dynamics of learning
through (direct) feedback alignment.

In his spare time, he enjoys watching movie, reading novels and playing chess.
