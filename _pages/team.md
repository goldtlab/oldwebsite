<div style="font-size:130%; font-weight:bold">Sebastian Goldt</div><br/> 

Sebastian is an Assistant Professor in the nascent Department of Data Science at
SISSA. He studied physics at Cambridge University and he did his PhD with Udo
Seifert at the University of Stuttgart, where he worked on the stochastic
thermodynamics of learning. Before coming to Trieste, Sebastian spent three
years as a post-doc with Florent Krzakala and Lenka Zdeborová in Paris, studying
the theory of neural networks.</p>

<p>He loves playing sports, discovering Trieste and its surroundings, and buying
more books than he manages to read.</p>

<div style="font-size:130%; font-weight:bold">Eszter Székely (Postdoc)</div><br/>

Eszter is a post-doc working on neural networks and Gaussian processes.  Before
joining SISSA, she did her PhD in Gábor Csányi's group at Cambridge. During her
PhD, she developed data-driven models for small molecules using mostly Gaussian
processes. In her free time, she enjoys reading, hiking, knitting, making
origami and occassionally, playing the piano.

Sara is a PhD student in the Data Science of SISSA. She graduated in
Quantitative and Computational Biology carrying out a thesis about the benchmark
of over-parametrized supervised learning approaches under the supervision of
Alessandro Laio and worked as a software engineer in eXact lab.</p>

<p>In her spare time, she enjoys climbing, cooking, knitting and reading. When
allowed, she plays wind instruments in the local orchestra.</p>

<div style="font-size:130%; font-weight:bold">Doğan Can Demirbilek (MSc, 2021)</div><br/>

Doğan read for the Master in Data Science and Scientific Computing at the
University of Trieste. His thesis looked at the dynamics of
learning through (direct) feedback alignment.</p>

<p>In his spare time, he enjoys watching movies, reading novels and playing
chess.</p>
