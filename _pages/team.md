Sebastian is an Assistant Professor in the nascent Department of Data Science at
SISSA. He studied physics at Cambridge University and he did his PhD with Udo
Seifert at the University of Stuttgart, where he worked on the stochastic
thermodynamics of learning. Before coming to Trieste, Sebastian spent three
years as a post-doc with Florent Krzakala and Lenka Zdeborová in Paris studying
the theory of neural networks.</p>

<p>He loves playing sports, discovering Trieste and its surroundings, and buying
more books than he manages to read.</p>
