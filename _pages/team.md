<div style="font-size:130%; font-weight:bold">Sebastian Goldt (PI)</div><br/> 

I am Assistant Professor in the nascent Department of Data Science at SISSA. I
studied physics at Cambridge University and did my PhD with Udo Seifert at the
University of Stuttgart, where I worked on the stochastic thermodynamics of
learning. Before coming to Trieste, I spent three years as a post-doc with
Florent Krzakala and Lenka Zdeborová in Paris studying the theory of neural
networks.</p>

<p>Doğan is a student of the Master in Data Science and Scientific Computing at the
University of Trieste. For his thesis, he will be working on the dynamics of
learning through (direct) feedback alignment.</p>

<p>In his spare time, he enjoys watching movies, reading novels and playing
chess.</p>
